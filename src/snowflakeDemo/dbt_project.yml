# You can define configurations for models in the `source-paths` directory here.
# Using these configurations, you can enable or disable models, change how they
# are materialized, and more!

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/ directory
# as views (the default). These settings can be overridden in the individual model files
# using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.
