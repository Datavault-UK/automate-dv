## We'd love to hear from you

dbtvault is very much a work in progress – we’re constantly adding quality of life improvements and will be adding
new table types regularly.

We know that it deserves new features, that the code base can be tidied up and the SQL better tuned. 

Rest assured we’re working on it for future releases – [our roadmap contains information on what’s coming](roadmap.md).
 
If you spot anything you’d like to bring to our attention, have a request for new features, have spotted an improvement we could make, 
or want to tell us about a typo or bug, then please don’t hesitate to let us know via [Github](https://github.com/Datavault-UK/dbtvault/issues). 

We’d rather know you are making active use of this package than hearing nothing from all of you out there! 

Happy Data Vaulting! :smile:
