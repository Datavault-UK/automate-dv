Feature: [SQLS-EFF-RM] Effectivity Satellites Loaded using Rank Materialization

  @fixture.eff_satellite
  Scenario: [SQLS-EFF-RM-001] Load data into a non-existent effectivity satellite
    Given the EFF_SAT table does not exist
    And the RAW_STAGE table contains data
      | CUSTOMER_ID | ORDER_ID | START_DATE | END_DATE   | EFFECTIVE_FROM | LOAD_DATE  | SOURCE |
      | 1000        | AAA      | 2020-01-09 | 9999-12-31 | 2020-01-09     | 2020-01-10 | orders |

    And I have a rank column DBTVAULT_RANK in the STG_CUSTOMER stage partitioned by CUSTOMER_ID and ordered by LOAD_DATE
    And I stage the STG_CUSTOMER data
    And I insert by rank into the EFF_SAT eff_sat
    Then the EFF_SAT table should contain expected data
