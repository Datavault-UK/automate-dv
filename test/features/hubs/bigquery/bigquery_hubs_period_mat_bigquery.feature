Feature: [BQ-HUB-PM] Hubs Loaded using Period Materialization

  @fixture.single_source_hub
  Scenario: [BQ-HUB-PM-001] Simple load of stage data into an empty hub
    Given the HUB table does not exist
    And the RAW_STAGE table contains data
      | CUSTOMER_ID | CUSTOMER_NAME | LOAD_DATE  | SOURCE |

    And I stage the STG_CUSTOMER data
    And I insert by period into the HUB hub by day
    And I insert by period into the HUB hub by day
    Then the HUB table should contain expected data
