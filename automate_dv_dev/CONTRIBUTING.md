## Contributing new features

Please refer to our contribution guidelines over on our [development repository](https://github.com/Datavault-UK/dbtvault-dev/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## We'd love to hear from you

dbtvault is very much a work in progress – we’re constantly adding quality of life improvements and will be adding
new table types regularly.

Rest assured we’re working on future releases – [our roadmap contains information on what’s coming](https://dbtvault.readthedocs.io/en/latest/roadmap/).
 
If you spot anything you’d like to bring to our attention, have a request for new features, have spotted an improvement we could make, 
or want to tell us about a typo or bug, then please don’t hesitate to let us know via [github](https://github.com/Datavault-UK/dbtvault/issues). 

We’d rather know you are making active use of this package than hearing nothing from all of you out there! 

Happy Data Vaulting!
